    "description": "Hello Rackers - As we look at accelerating the velocity of AI Fluency and excellence its become clear to me is that we have amazing superpowers distributed globally across our 5000+ Rackers. The question is how do we \"mine\" those superpowers. It would be wonderful if we had 1)  a repository of who knows what (who are our domain SMEs), 2)  what AI solutions have been built either internally or for customer in a way that might be by our new Rex 2.0 engine to assess how we could reuse solution patterns and agents that have built - Any creative thoughts on how to do this simply and at scale? - what data would we want to capture, how do get that data, how do we maintain and keep the repository current? Need some help here.",
